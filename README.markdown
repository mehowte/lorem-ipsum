About
-----

lorem-ipsum is a random text generator written in Ruby. It works by first
scanning a list of text files and generating some statistics based on the text.
From there, it can generate an arbitrary amount of random text, which should
look and feel reasonably similar to the text provided, while still essentially
amounting to gibberish.
